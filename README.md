- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunbee 🌞 🐝 
- 👀 I’m interested in creation, connection, collaboration around tech.
- 🌱 My repertoire includes building apps for mobile and microprocessors.
- - I speak Python, Kotlin, C++, Javascript and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a maker on tech that prevents infant deaths in a hot car. These deaths are totally preventable but car manufacturers won't invest in a solution because there aren't any billions to be made saving little lives. :exploding_head:
