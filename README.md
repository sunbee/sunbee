- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunbee
- 👀 I’m interested in creation, connection, collaboration around tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning home automation with ESP8266-12E nodemcu, IoT Stack on Raspberry Pi and MIT App Inventor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a chic who codes on preventing child deaths in a hot car. These deaths are totally avoidable but car manufacturers won't invest in a solution because there aren't any billions to be made saving children's lives.
- 📫 How to reach me sanjay.bhatikar@gmail.com, put your favorite beer in subject.
