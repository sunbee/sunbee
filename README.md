- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunbee
- 👀 I’m interested in creation, connection, collaboration around tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently building home automation with ESP8266-12E nodemcu, IoT Stack on Raspberry Pi and MIT App Inventor.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a maker chic on tech that prevents infant deaths in a hot car. These deaths are totally preventable but car manufacturers won't invest in a solution because there aren't any billions to be made saving little lives. :exploding_head:
- 📫 How to reach me sanjay.bhatikar@gmail.com, put your favorite 🍺 in subject.
